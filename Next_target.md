### Yet to do :
- Trying to integrate NTL and OpenMPI.<br/>
- Reading about 'fields'.<br/>
- Reading and understanding the Las Vegas algorithm.<br/>
- Understanding the send, receive, broadcast and barrier functions of OpenMPI.<br/>
- Reading about the NVIDIA course.<br/>

### Done :
✅ Running NTL examples : ZZ_p matrix programs.<br/>
✅ Finding the count of (n-1)x(n-1) submatrices in nxn matrices.<br/>
✅ Finding all 2x2 and 3x3 (in general nxn minors) in a bigger matrix. <br/>
✅ Optimize general nxn matrix program to a matrix that is created withing a specific field of a 15-30 bit prime number, and calculating their determinants and keeping count of the determinants that are 0, i.e the count of Zero Minors in that matrix.
