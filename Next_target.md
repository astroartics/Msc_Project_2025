### Yet to do :
- Reading and understanding the Las Vegas algorithm.<br/>
- Understanding the send, receive, broadcast and barrier functions of OpenMPI.<br/>
- Reading about the NVIDIA course.<br/>

### Done :
✅ Running NTL examples : ZZ_p matrix programs.<br/>
✅ Finding the count of (n-1)x(n-1) submatrices in nxn matrices.<br/>
✅ Finding all 2x2 and 3x3 (in general nxn minors) in a bigger matrix. <br/>
✅ Optimize general nxn matrix program to a matrix that is created withing a specific field of a 15-30 bit prime number, and calculating their determinants and keeping count of the determinants that are 0, i.e the count of Zero Minors in that matrix.<br/>
✅ Trying to integrate NTL and OpenMPI.<br/>
✅ Dividing the minor calculations and process of getting the minors in 4 processors, each of which will get 'n' combinations for the minor indices each.<br/>
✅ Reading about 'finite fields'.<br/>
✅ Trying out the written 'kth-combination with OpenMPI' code on the server with more than 4 processors and gauging the performance.
