Reading about 'fields'.<br/>
Reading and understanding the Las Vegas algorithm.<br/>
Understanding the send, receive, broadcast and barrier functions of OpenMPI.<br/>
Reading about the NVIDIA course.
Finding all 2x2 and 3x3 (in general nxn minors) in a bigger matrix that is created withing a specific field of a 15-30 bit prime number, and calculating their determinants and keeping count of the determinants that are 0.
