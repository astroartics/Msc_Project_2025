## Finite Fields in Cryptography

- GF(p): A finite field with a prime number p of elements. The elements of GF(p) are the integers {0,1,2,…,p−1}, and the arithmetic is performed modulo p.
- GF(p^n): A finite field with p^n elements, where p is a prime number and n is a positive integer. These fields are often used in elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) or when constructing more complex cryptosystems.

- Mathematical Structure: Finite fields provide a well-defined and predictable mathematical structure for cryptographic algorithms. They ensure that every element (except 0) has a multiplicative inverse, which is essential for many cryptographic protocols.
- Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC): ECC relies on arithmetic over finite fields, typically GF(p) or GF(p^n), to create secure cryptographic systems with smaller keys than other methods like RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, a public-key cryptography algorithm).
